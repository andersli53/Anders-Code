A first-principle predictive theory for a sphere falling 
through sharply stratified fluid at low Reynolds number
RCAMASSA, CFALCON, JLIN, RM.McLAUGHLIN and NMYKINS

A sphere exhibits a prolonged residence time when settling through a stable 
stratification of miscible fluids 
due to the deformation of the fluid-density field.
